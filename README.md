# Object Detection with YOLO
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to perform object detection in images and videos. The project is implemented in Python and uses open-source libraries such as OpenCV and Numpy.

### Requirements
The following libraries must be installed to run this project:

- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional)

### Usage
To run the object detection, use the following command:
```
python object_detection.py --image <path to image>
```

To run the object detection on a video, use the following command:
```
python object_detection.py --video <path to video>
```

### Results
The object detection results will be displayed on the screen with bounding boxes around the detected objects and their class labels. The results can also be saved as an image or video file.

### Note
This project uses a pre-trained YOLO model and is only intended for educational purposes. To improve the object detection accuracy, you can train the model on your own custom dataset.
